# üìß RESEND DOMAIN VERIFICATION - STEP BY STEP GUIDE

## Current Status: ‚ùå Domain NOT Verified

Your Resend API key is working, but rvaglowco.com needs to be verified before you can send emails to getlit@rvaglowco.com.

---

## üîß HOW TO VERIFY YOUR DOMAIN (10-15 minutes)

### Step 1: Log into Resend
1. Go to: https://resend.com/login
2. Log in with your account

### Step 2: Add Your Domain
1. Click on "Domains" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add Domain" button
3. Enter: `rvaglowco.com`
4. Click "Add"

### Step 3: Get DNS Records
Resend will show you DNS records to add. They look like this:

**Record 1 - SPF Record (TXT)**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or rvaglowco.com)
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
TTL: 3600
```

**Record 2 - DKIM Record (TXT)**
```
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: (a long string starting with p=...)
TTL: 3600
```

**Record 3 - DMARC Record (TXT)** (Optional but recommended)
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none
TTL: 3600
```

### Step 4: Add Records to SiteGround

1. **Log into SiteGround**
   - Go to: https://my.siteground.com
   - Log in with your credentials

2. **Access DNS Zone Editor**
   - Click on "Websites" in the top menu
   - Find rvaglowco.com and click "Site Tools"
   - Navigate to: Domain ‚Üí DNS Zone Editor

3. **Add Each DNS Record**

   **For each TXT record from Resend:**
   - Click "Add New Record"
   - Type: Select "TXT"
   - Name: Enter the name from Resend (e.g., `@`, `resend._domainkey`, `_dmarc`)
   - TTL: 3600 (or leave default)
   - TXT Data/Value: Copy-paste the exact value from Resend
   - Click "Create"

4. **Example Screenshots of What to Enter:**

   **SPF Record:**
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Host: @
   Points to: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
   ```

   **DKIM Record:**
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Host: resend._domainkey
   Points to: [paste the long p= string from Resend]
   ```

### Step 5: Verify in Resend

1. Go back to Resend dashboard
2. Click on your domain (rvaglowco.com)
3. Click "Verify" button
4. If it shows ‚úÖ green checkmarks, you're done!
5. If it shows ‚ùå red X:
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS to propagate
   - Click "Verify" again
   - Repeat until all records show green

### Step 6: Test Email Sending

Once you see all green checkmarks in Resend:

1. Come back to me and say "domain is verified"
2. I'll update the code to use getlit@rvaglowco.com
3. We'll run a test to confirm emails work

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIMELINE

- Adding DNS records: 5 minutes
- DNS propagation: 5-30 minutes (usually ~10 minutes)
- Verification: Instant once DNS propagates

**Total time: 10-35 minutes**

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Records not found" in Resend after adding to SiteGround

**Solution**: DNS takes time to propagate. Wait 10-15 minutes and try again.

### "SPF record already exists"

**Solution**:
1. Find your existing SPF record in SiteGround
2. Modify it to include Resend's SPF:
   - Old: `v=spf1 ... ~all`
   - New: `v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ... ~all`

### Can't find DNS Zone Editor in SiteGround

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're in "Site Tools" not "My Accounts"
2. Look under: Domain ‚Üí DNS Zone Editor
3. If still not visible, contact SiteGround support

### Verification stuck on "Pending"

**Solution**:
1. Check you entered records exactly as shown (no extra spaces)
2. Wait 30 minutes for DNS propagation
3. Use DNS checker: https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx
   - Enter: `resend._domainkey.rvaglowco.com`
   - Should show your DKIM record
